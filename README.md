  <h1>Python Learning Roadmap</h1>
  <p style="margin-top: -5px;"><em>(For Beginners & Aspiring DS/AI Students)</em></p>
</div>

This roadmap is paired with a curated collection of Python books (linked at the end) and is designed for:

- 🔵 **Complete Beginners** (non-programmers, non-CS background, or those new to Python even if they know other languages).  
- 🔵 **Aspiring Data Science & AI/ML Students** (like engineers preparing for Masters) who want to use Python as their foundation.  

⚠️ Note: This is not a full Data Science/AI course roadmap.  
It is a **Python-focused study plan**, with two tracks:  
- **General Python Programming** for anyone.  
- **Python for DS/AI Preparation** for those planning to advance into Data Science & AI.

## 📌 Part 1: General Programming Roadmap (For Any Beginner)  

### Step 1: Learn Python Basics  
**Book:** *Python Crash Course* (by Eric Matthes)  
**Why:** Beginner-friendly, project-based learning.  

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Learn Python syntax, loops, functions, and OOP basics.  
- [ ] Build small projects (games, data visualization, web app).  

---

### Step 2: Apply Python in the Real World  
**Book:** *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* (by Al Sweigart)  
**Why:** Learn how to use Python for productivity & automation.  

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Automate Excel & CSVs.  
- [ ] Scrape websites & handle emails.  
- [ ] Get comfortable solving practical problems with Python.  

---

### Step 3: Strengthen Theory (Optional)  
**Book:** *Think Python* (by Allen Downey)  
**Why:** Builds deeper CS understanding (recursion, OOP, algorithms).  

**Use Case:** Recommended if you want to strengthen programming logic, or if preparing for technical interviews / academic study.  

---

## 📌 Part 2: Data Science & AI/ML Roadmap (For Master’s Prep)  

### Step 4: Transition to Data Science  
**Book (Recommended):** *Python Data Science Handbook* (by Jake VanderPlas)  
**Alternative:** *Python for Data Analysis* (Wes McKinney) [Read Online]( https://wesmckinney.com/book/)<br>
**Why:** Learn pandas, NumPy, matplotlib for data handling & visualization.  

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Practice with datasets (Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repo).  
- [ ] Perform data cleaning, wrangling, and exploratory analysis.  

---

### Step 5: Learn Machine Learning & AI  
**Book:** *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* (by Aurélien Géron)  
**Why:** Covers regression, classification, clustering, neural networks.  

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Implement ML models step by step.  
- [ ] Work on portfolio projects (predictive modeling, deep learning).  

---

## 🔑 Notes  
- Beginners should first complete **Part 1** (basic Python + automation).  
- Those targeting **DS/AI** should continue with **Part 2** after Step 2.  
- *Think Python* is optional but recommended for sharpening programming logic and core computing techniques.  

📌 Alongside books:  
- [ ] Practice coding on **LeetCode / HackerRank**.  
- [ ] Explore small datasets on **Kaggle**.  
- [ ] Document projects in a **GitHub portfolio**.
